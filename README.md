# Project-Lab-4

Code is for a Remote Controlled rover with a FPV camera.
The rover is controlled using a wireless Xbox 360 controller.
A Raspberry Pi 4 was used to program the rover.
A USB camera was connected to the RaspberryPi 4 and was used as a FPV camera. The camera was mounted on top of a servo motor. The rotation of the servo controlled the camera angle. 
Code is primarily written in Python3. Packages used are: numpy, open-cv, Flask, evdev and their dependencies. All packages are for a Raspberry Pi 4 running under the Raspberry Pi OS (RasbianOS) which is a fork of Debian Linux for ARM processors.
Hardware and Rover design not included.
